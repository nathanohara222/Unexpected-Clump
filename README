Unexpected Clump is a web-based card game for people to play in a party 
with phones or other devices. The target is to develop a cross platform 
website and allow users to play a game without ever need to download any 
application.


Planned product:

There is a judge and couple players. A judge initials the game in the 
website and gets a room number where player can join with their devices.

Once a judge indicates all players are in, the website pushes each 
player some "character" cards(C), some "equipment" cards(E), and some 
"status" cards(S).

The cards may look like

[C1]Professor: You can define a specific study of field and 
               gain 1 resource of from a university.
[C2]Hacker: This character negates other's technology equipment cards.
[E1]Chain-saw
[E2]Cute colored dress: choose the color to charm the judge.
[S1]Just finished coffee in the morning
[S2]Drunk and puke on a bus: needs to pay $100 clean up fee

Then the judge will say what the winner rule of this around, such as 
"the smartest clump". 

Player A choose a hacker with cute pink dress who just 
finished coffee in the morning. 

Player B have a college student with 
brain transplant who never get high with weed. 

Once the player choose their clump, the information is send to the judge
and player can show what they have pick on their screen to everyone.

In this case, A and B must argue who's the best for the winning 
condition for the round, and then judge will pick the winner. 
Whoever wins the most in 5 round is the winner of the game.
